# Stage 1: Strategy & Vision

## Overview

This stage establishes **why** you're building a project and what success looks like. Every project begins with clear intent, not just technical requirements.

## Core Purpose

Define the problem, opportunity, and value proposition before writing a single line of code.

## Key Artifacts

### 1. Vision Statement
- **Format**: 1-2 sentences
- **Content**: What problem are you solving? Who benefits?
- **Example**: "Build an AI-assisted sales pipeline tracker that helps account managers identify high-value opportunities 10x faster."

### 2. Business Value Proposition
- Who is this for?
- What outcomes does it deliver?
- Why now?
- What alternatives exist?

### 3. Success Metrics
- **Quantitative**: User adoption, time saved, cost reduction
- **Qualitative**: User feedback, stakeholder confidence

## Template Questions

Answer these before moving to requirements:

1. **Problem**: What specific pain point are you addressing?
2. **Audience**: Who will use this?
3. **Outcome**: What changes after this exists?
4. **Constraints**: Time, budget, technical limitations?
5. **Success Criteria**: How will you know this worked?

## Why This Stage Matters

✅ **Prevents scope creep** - Clear boundaries from day one  
✅ **Aligns stakeholders** - Everyone understands the "why"  
✅ **Guides decisions** - Every feature choice maps back to vision  
✅ **Builds credibility** - Professional projects start with strategy

## Best Practices

1. **Write it down** - Verbal agreements fade, documents don't
2. **Keep it simple** - One page maximum
3. **Make it testable** - Success criteria should be measurable
4. **Get feedback early** - Share with stakeholders before coding

## Example: AI Experiment Tracker

### Vision
Create a personal knowledge base where I can log AI experiments, track what prompts work, and build institutional knowledge about effective AI usage patterns.

### Business Value
- **For**: Product managers and business leaders experimenting with AI
- **Delivers**: Faster learning, reusable prompts, measurable improvement
- **Alternative**: Spreadsheets (unstructured, hard to search)

### Success Metrics
- 50+ experiments logged in 30 days
- 5+ reusable prompt templates created
- Demonstrate to stakeholders in client presentations

## Deliverables Checklist

Before moving to Stage 2 (Requirements), ensure you have:

- [ ] Vision statement (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Target audience identified
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Business value articulated
- [ ] Constraints documented

## Tools & Resources

- **ChatPRD**: Generate strategy docs from conversations
- **ChatGPT**: Refine vision statements
- **Notion/Markdown**: Document and version strategy

## Next Stage

Once vision is clear, proceed to **[Stage 2: Requirements](02_Requirements.md)** to define *what* the system must do.
